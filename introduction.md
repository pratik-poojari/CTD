### Introduction to Data Analysis

**Contributor Note**  
This is a working outline for Python 200, Week 1. Each section below needs to be expanded into a full lesson. Use the code ideas and goals as a starting point, feel free to add examples, exercises, and links to visualizations or datasets.

## Motivation

Let’s begin with understanding why Python, why are we even doing this, why not something else.

How do we communicate with people? Maybe using a language like English or Spanish, right?

In the same way, what do we do if we think about a concept or an idea and we want to explain it to the computer? Python is one such language that the computer understands, and today we chose to learn Python as it's a good option when working with tasks related to analytics and machine learning.

So, it's more important to begin by understanding the three letters **W.W.H.**

1. **What**: What are we trying to do? *Your Question.*  
2. **Why**: Why are we even thinking about doing it? *Your reason/purpose.*  
3. **How**: How are we going to do it? *Your logic.*  

So, it's far more important to have clarity in mind before we jump onto any piece of code.

Therefore, **Programming language/libraries/framework/tools = method to represent your thoughts in a way that the computer can understand.**
