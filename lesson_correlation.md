# Lesson 3: Correlation

## Wondering what is Correlation?

Correlation tells us how two things move together.

**Pearson correlation (r):** It‚Äôs a number between -1 and +1:  
- **+1**: Perfect positive relationship: as one goes up, the other goes up too.  
- **-1**: Perfect negative relationship: as one goes up, the other goes down.  
- **0**: No linear relationship: one moving doesn‚Äôt predict the other.  

**Real life examples:**  
- Positive correlation (+): Height vs shoe size (taller people usually have bigger feet).  
- Negative correlation (-): Hours spent gaming vs hours sleeping (the more you game, the less you sleep).  
- No correlation (0): Shoe size vs exam score (shoe size doesn‚Äôt affect grades).  

Correlation shows if two things move together, and how strongly.

## Why Correlation Matters

Correlation is more than just a number, it‚Äôs a tool that helps us understand relationships in data.

**In real life it helps us answer questions like:**  
- Business: Does spending more on ads increase sales?  
- Education: Do more hours of study lead to better exam scores?  
- Health: Is exercise time linked with lower blood pressure?  

In data analysis & machine learning:  
- Correlation helps us choose useful features.  
- Example: If two variables are almost identical (like height in cm and height in inches), we don‚Äôt need both.  

‚ö†Ô∏è It also helps us avoid mistakes.  
Example: Ice cream sales and drowning both go up in summer. That doesn‚Äôt mean ice cream causes drowning.  

So, correlation matters because it helps us find patterns, make better decisions, and avoid false conclusions.

## Visualizing Correlation

Numbers are useful, but sometimes it‚Äôs easier to see relationships.

### Scatterplots (two variables)

Example: Study Hours vs Exam Scores  

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

study_hours = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
exam_scores = [50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85]

plt.scatter(study_hours, exam_scores)
plt.title("Study Hours vs Exam Scores")
plt.xlabel("Study Hours")
plt.ylabel("Exam Scores")
plt.show()
```

**Interpretation:**  
The dots go upwards together, as study hours increase, exam scores increase.  
This shows a positive correlation (more study = better scores).

---

### Heatmaps (many variables at once)

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

# Small dataset
data = {
    "hours_study": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "exam_score": [50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85],
    "sleep_hours": [8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Correlation matrix
corr = df.corr()

# Heatmap
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
plt.title("Correlation Heatmap")
plt.show()
```

**Interpretation:**  
- hours_study and exam_score ‚Üí strongly positive (close to +1).  
- sleep_hours and hours_study ‚Üí negative correlation (more study, less sleep).  

‚úÖ Use scatterplots to see two-variable relationships.  
‚úÖ Use heatmaps to see relationships across many variables.

## Calculating Correlation

### Using NumPy: `np.corrcoef()`

```python
import numpy as np

study_hours = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
exam_scores = [50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85]

# Correlation matrix
corr_matrix = np.corrcoef(study_hours, exam_scores)
print(corr_matrix)
```

**Output:**  
```
[[1. 1.]
 [1. 1.]]
```

---

### Using Pandas: `.corr()`

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "hours_study": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "exam_score": [50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85],
    "sleep_hours": [8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Correlation matrix
print(df.corr())
```

**Interpretation:**  
- hours_study & exam_score ‚Üí strong positive correlation.  
- hours_study & sleep_hours ‚Üí negative correlation.  
- exam_score & sleep_hours ‚Üí negative correlation.

## Positive, Negative & No Correlation Examples

### Positive Correlation

```python
import numpy as np

study_hours = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
exam_scores = [50, 55, 60, 65, 70]

print(np.corrcoef(study_hours, exam_scores))
```

Output shows correlation close to +1.

---

### Negative Correlation

```python
gaming_hours = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sleep_hours = [8, 7, 6, 5, 4]

print(np.corrcoef(gaming_hours, sleep_hours))
```

Output shows correlation close to -1.

---

### No Correlation

```python
shoe_size = [38, 40, 42, 44, 46]
exam_scores = [60, 85, 70, 65, 90]

print(np.corrcoef(shoe_size, exam_scores))
```

Output shows correlation close to 0.

## Pitfalls of Correlation

- **Correlation ‚â† Causation**: Ice cream sales ‚â† drowning.  
- **Outliers Can Mislead**: One strange data point can distort correlation.  
- **Large Datasets**: Tiny effects can look ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù in huge datasets.  

üëâ Always visualize and think logically before trusting correlation numbers.

## Quick Quiz üéØ

**Q1. If the correlation between study hours and exam scores is +0.9, what does that mean?**  
A1. It means students who study more tend to score higher (strong positive relationship).  

**Q2. If the correlation between gaming hours and sleep hours is -0.8, what does that mean?**  
A2. It means students who game more tend to sleep less (strong negative relationship).  

**Q3. Shoe size and exam scores show a correlation close to 0. What does that mean?**  
A3. It means shoe size and exam scores have no meaningful relationship (no correlation).
