## Pandas

Pandas is a Python library that makes it easy to work with structured data, like tables you‚Äôd see in Excel or a database. It helps you store, clean, analyze, and explore data quickly and efficiently.

There is a ton of data being generated and processed every second and most real-world data comes in messy formats, missing values, weird columns, extra info, or in files like CSVs or Excel spreadsheets.

**Pandas helps you:**
- Load that data into Python.  
- Clean it up.  
- Ask useful questions like:  
  - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the average income in this dataset?‚Äù  
  - ‚ÄúHow many people signed up last week?‚Äù  
  - ‚ÄúWhich product had the most sales?‚Äù  

It‚Äôs used in data analytics, machine learning, finance, science, and pretty much anywhere people work with data.

## Getting Started with Pandas

### What is a DataFrame and a Series?

**DataFrame**  
You can think of a DataFrame as a two-dimensional table or a spreadsheet in Python.  
- It has rows and columns.  
- Each column has a name.  
- Each row has an index number.

Rule of Thumb: a DataFrame has two axes, just like a table.  
- **Rows** (top to bottom) = Axis 0  
- **Columns** (left to right) = Axis 1

**Series**  
You can think of a Series as just one column from a DataFrame.  
- It has values and an index, but only one column.  
- Can store heterogeneous data types.  
- A Series is like a fancy list that knows the name of each item.

## Installing and Importing Pandas

```bash
pip install pandas
```

Once installed, import it into your Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

---

## Reading from a CSV File

**What is a CSV file?**  
CSV = Comma-Separated Values. It‚Äôs a plain text file that looks like a spreadsheet, where each row is a line and columns are separated by commas.

```python
# Read data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('customers_100.csv')
```

---

## Creating a DataFrame

You can create DataFrames in several ways:

**From a Dictionary (most common):**  
```python
data = {
    "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"],
    "age": [25, 30, 22],
    "grade": ["A", "B", "A"]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

**From a List of Dictionaries:**  
```python
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "grade": "A"},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "grade": "B"}
]
df = pd.DataFrame(students)
print(df)
```

**From a List of Lists (with column names):**  
```python
data = [
    ["Alice", 25, "A"],
    ["Bob", 30, "B"],
    ["Carol", 22, "A"]
]
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["name", "age", "grade"])
print(df)
```

## Creating a Series

**From a Python list:**  
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
num_series = pd.Series(numbers)
print(num_series)
```
<img width="298" height="209" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 6 41 29‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a063e18-7225-46aa-850b-e75c34a96bab" />

**From a list with custom labels:**  
```python
data = [85, 90, 95]
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
my_series = pd.Series(data, index=names)
print(my_series)
```
<img width="286" height="207" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 6 41 48‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd95702-65bb-4439-beb8-44e5d9cca183" />

**From a Dictionary:**  
```python
data = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 90, "Carol": 95}
my_dict_series = pd.Series(data)
print(my_dict_series)
```
<img width="282" height="226" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 6 42 02‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8771a74-4755-43f1-ae0c-3ec630c46ee0" />

## Reading a Series from a DataFrame

A **Series** in Pandas represents a single column of data. To understand this better, let‚Äôs first create a simple DataFrame and then select a column from it.

### Step 1: Create a DataFrame

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"],
    "age": [25, 30, 22]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

<img width="312" height="213" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 7 07 44‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0ecca13-57e7-45c7-9919-f9da6e56cf63" />

## Why Series are Important

- A DataFrame is really just a collection of Series.  
- Series can have **labels** (indexes) which make it easy to access values.  
- Series handle **missing data** with NaN gracefully.  
- Let‚Äôs test this concept
```python
s = pd.Series([85, 90, 95], index=["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"])
print(s["Bob"])  # Output: 90

- Another important reason, series handles missing data effortlessly. Missing Data = gaps or no values or None values
- Pandas allows NaN inside a Series. Instead of crashing or giving wrong results, it understands that the value is missing.
- Let‚Äôs test

s = pd.Series([10, None, 30])
print(s)  # Handles missing values
```

## Exploring Your Data in Pandas

When you load a dataset, you might want to get a quick look at it. Pandas provides:  
- `.head()` ‚Üí Peek at first few rows  
- `.tail()` ‚Üí Peek at last few rows  
- `.info()` ‚Üí Structure, datatypes, missing values  
- `.describe()` ‚Üí Quick statistics summary  

Example with `students.csv`:Let‚Äôs Load the data using-import pandas as pd 
- optional if you already have imported pandas {students_df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")}
- Here‚Äôs what the dataset looks like:
<img width="653" height="323" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 6 46 31‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f17a569-dfd4-4314-9a79-3b126d059b39" />


- .head(): Take a Peek
Think of .head() as saying:
‚ÄúShow me just the first few rows so I can see what‚Äôs inside.‚Äù By default, .head() shows the first 5 rows of your dataset. You can also peek at more rows: df.head(10) for 10 rows.

Let‚Äôs try: print(students_df.head(2)) #prints first 2 rows
<img width="577" height="199" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 7 00 25‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19088215-7512-418a-af85-025592f52775" />

- .tail(): Look at the End. If .head() is a sneak peek at the start, then .tail() is a sneak peek at the end.
- By default, .tail() shows the last 5 rows of your dataset.
- Let‚Äôs try: print(students_df.tail()) #prints last 5 rows.

print(students_df.tail())    # Last 5 rows
```
<img width="516" height="280" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 6 48 17‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5190b786-a3a7-4d91-9621-76b0a17308e2" />

- .info():  Get the Blueprint
- .info() is like asking Pandas: ‚ÄúTell me the structure of this dataset.‚Äù
- Let‚Äôs try: print(students_df.info())
- When you run df.info(), Pandas gives you a summary report of your DataFrame.
<img width="445" height="334" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 6 49 45‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/183e4323-3c7b-43f8-a92f-c9dc36b7e6d4" />

- Understanding .info() Output
RangeIndex: The dataset has 6 rows (0 to 5).
Data columns:  The dataset has 6 columns.
Columns: id, name, age, grade, city, score.
Missing values: Some columns have missing values: age, grade, city, score.
Data types: Numbers (int, float) and text (object).
.describe(): Quick Statistics
.describe() gives you a quick summary of the numbers in your dataset.

- Let‚Äôs try: print(students_df.describe())
Gives us:

<img width="432" height="205" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 6 50 58‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43c25eb3-50fc-4423-ae0f-0408e62cdec5" />

- What .describe() tells us:
count: how many values (notice 5, not 6, because of missing data)
mean: the average
min & max: smallest and biggest
25%, 50%, 75%: quartiles (like checkpoints in the data)

So .describe() is like a quick health report of your numbers.



- Quick tip
Usually the experts suggest these three are always the first commands you should run after loading any dataset, so that you get a good knowledge of your data you will be working with.
